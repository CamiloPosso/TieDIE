abstract = {Aberrant activation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway is associated with numerous human cancers and often correlates with the overexpression or amplification of the c-myc oncogene. Paradoxical to the cellular transformation potential of c-Myc is its ability to also induce apoptosis. Using an inducible c-MycER expression system, we found that Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling suppressed apoptosis by inhibiting c-Myc-induced release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. Both cyclooxygenase 2 and WISP-1 were identified as effectors of the Wnt-mediated antiapoptotic signal. Soft agar assays showed that neither c-Myc nor Wnt-1 alone was sufficient to induce cellular transformation, but that Wnt and c-Myc coordinated in inducing transformation. Furthermore, coexpression of Wnt-1 and c-Myc induced high-frequency and rapid tumor growth in nude mice. Extensive apoptotic bodies were characteristic of c-Myc-induced tumors, but not tumors induced by coactivation of c-Myc and Wnt-1, indicating that the antiapoptotic function of Wnt-1 plays a critical role in the synergetic action between c-Myc and Wnt-1. These results elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Wnt/{beta}-catenin inhibits apoptosis and provide new insight into Wnt signaling-mediated oncogenesis.

abstract ={Motivation: In model organisms such as yeast, large
databases of  protein‚Äìprotein and protein-DNA interactions have
become an extremely  important resource for the study of protein
function, evolution, and gene  regulatory dynamics. In this
paper we demonstrate that by integrating these  interactions
with widely-available mRNA expression data, it is possible to 
generate concrete hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms
governing the  observed changes in gene expression. To perform
this integration  systematically and at large scale, we
introduce an approach for screening a  molecular interaction
network to identify active subnetworks, i.e.,  connected 
regions of the network that show significant changes in
expression over  particular subsets of conditions. The method we
present here combines a  rigorous statistical measure for
scoring subnetworks with a search algorithm  for identifying
subnetworks with high score.Results: We evaluated our procedure on a small network of 332 genes and 362
interactions and a large network of 4160 genes containing all 7462 
protein‚Äìprotein and protein-DNA interactions in the yeast public
databases.  In the case of the small network, we identified five
significant subnetworks  that covered 41 out of 77 (53%) of all
significant changes in expression.  Both network analyses returned
several top-scoring subnetworks with good  correspondence to known
regulatory mechanisms in the literature. These  results demonstrate
how large-scale genomic approaches may be used to  uncover signalling
and regulatory pathways in a systematic, integrative  fashion.Availability: The methods presented in this paper are

When applied to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae synthetic lethal genetic interaction network, we can achieve a precision around 50% with 20% to 50% recall in the genome-wide prediction of new genetic interactions, supported by experimental validation.

abstract ={Motivation: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe.Results: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods.Availability: SPIA was implemented as an R package available at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/ontoexpress/Contact: sorin@wayne.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={The concept of pagerank was first started as a way for determining the ranking of Web pages by Web search engines. Based on relations in interconnected networks, pagerank has become a major tool for addressing fundamental problems arising in general graphs, especially for large information networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes. A notable notion of pagerank, introduced by Brin and Page and denoted by PageRank, is based on random walks as a geometric sum. In this paper, we consider a notion of pagerank that is based on the (discrete) heat kernel and can be expressed as an exponential sum of random walks. The heat kernel satisfies the heat equation and can be used to analyze many useful properties of random walks in a graph. A local Cheeger inequality is established, which implies that, by focusing on cuts determined by linear orderings of vertices using the heat kernel pageranks, the resulting partition is within a quadratic factor of the optimum. This is true, even if we restrict the volume of the small part separated by the cut to be close to some specified target value. This leads to a graph partitioning algorithm for which the running time is proportional to the size of the targeted volume (instead of the size of the whole graph).},

This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.

The original PageRank algorithm uses the Power Method to compute successive iterates that converge to the principal eigenvector of the Markov matrix representing the Web link graph.  The algorithm presented here, called Power Extrapolation, accelerates the convergence of the Power Method by subtracting off the error along several nonprincipal eigenvectors from the current iterate of the Power Method, making use of known nonprincipal eigenvalues of the Web hyperlink matrix. Empirically, we show that using Power Extrapolation speeds up PageRank computation by 30% on a Web graph of 80 million nodes in realistic scenarios over the standard power method, in a way that is simple to understand and implement. }

abstract ={Proteomics has the potential to provide answers in cancer pathogenesis and to direct targeted therapy through the comprehensive analysis of protein expression levels and activation status. The realization of this potential requires the development of new, rapid, high-throughput technologies for performing protein arrays on patient samples, as well as novel analytic techniques to interpret them. Herein, we describe the validation and robustness of using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) for the analysis of primary acute myelogenous leukemia samples as well as leukemic and normal stem cells. In this report, we show that array printing, detection, amplification, and staining precision are very high, reproducible, and that they correlate with traditional Western blotting. Using replicates of the same sample on the same and/or separate arrays, or using separate protein samples prepared from the same starting sample, the intra- and interarray reproducibility was extremely high. No statistically significant difference in protein signal intensities could be detected within the array setups. The activation status (phosphorylation) was maintained in experiments testing delayed processing and preparation from multiple freeze-thawed samples. Differences in protein expression could reliably be detected in as few as three cell protein equivalents. RPPA prepared from rare populations of normal and leukemic stem cells were successfully done and showed differences from bulk populations of cells. Examples show how RPPAs are ideally suited for the large-scale analysis of target identification, validation, and drug discovery. In summary, RPPA is a highly reliable, reproducible, high-throughput system that allows for the rapid large-scale proteomic analysis of protein expression and phosphorylation state in primary acute myelogenous leukemia cells, cell lines, and in human stem cells.
