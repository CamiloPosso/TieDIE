Version: 0.1

REQUIREMENTS:

	Python 2.7 and the python numpy module are required to run the tiedie 
	executable, when using a pre-computed diffusion kernel. 

	Either MATLAB or the python scipy module, version 0.12 or later, is 
	required for diffusion kernel computation: the latter is free, though
	not as computationally efficient as the MATLAB implementation.
