TieDIE: Tied Diffusion for Subnetwork Discovery. 

Version: 

0.1
	
Authors: 

Evan O. Paull, Daniel Carlin


REQUIREMENTS:

Python 2.7 and the python numpy module are required to run the tiedie 
executable, when using a pre-computed diffusion kernel. 

Either MATLAB or the python scipy module, version 0.12 or later, is 
required for diffusion kernel computation: the latter is free, though
not as computationally efficient as the MATLAB implementation.
